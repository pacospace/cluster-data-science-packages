# Data Science packages categorization

This project aims at clustering Python Packages for Data Science under specific categories.

The initial list of Python packages for data science that are used for this experiment can be found
in [100 Data Science Python Packages](https://github.com/pacospace/cluster-data-science-packages/blob/master/data/raw/hundreds_data_science_packages_initial_dataset.json).
This preliminary list has been selected with collegues from Red Hat AICoE and other departments at Red Hat.
